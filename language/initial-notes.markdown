-   Declarations
    -   Elemental Variables
        -   Integers: 16 bits, long 32 bits
            -   Signed (default) and unsigned
        -   Fixed-Point: 16 bits, long 32 bits
            -   Signed (default) and unsigned
            -   Requires specification of number of fractional bits.
        -   Characters: 8 bits
            -   Signed and unsigned (default)
        -   Pointers: 16 bits
        -   Arrays: 32 bits overhead (pointer and length)
    -   Records
        -   Like C structures
    -   Functions
        -   Functions are records with a jump pointer and metadata.
        -   Functions support recursion.
        -   Functions can be declared pure.
    -   Classes
        -   Multiple Inheritance (Priority List)
        -   Abstract Methods
        -   Objects are records with a pointer to a type record with a v-table.
        -   Methods are functions that take the object as the first argument.
        -   Access Specifiers
            -   Private: Just this class.
            -   Sheltered: Just this section.
            -   Protected: Subclasses and this section.
            -   Public: Anywhere.
    -   Sections
        -   Like C++ namespaces
